# Introduction to Gulp


The days of the casual web developer are over.  Since the advent of Visual Studio and other IDEs it’s been possible to build post back styled line-of-business applications with only a rudimentary understanding of web programming.  ASP.NET developers tended toward tolerating JavaScript and hoping ASP.NET would simply generate the proper JavaScript.

###WHY GULP

We are bombarded with a daily litany of new technologies “required” to build modern applications.  While every new technology might not actually be “required” it’s important to have some understanding of each technology's place in this world.  



###HOW TO USE THIS TUTORIAL
Working through this tutorial will expose you to a handful of the most important tasks you may need.  I recommend following the exercises, moving from kata to kata, in sequence.  During this process you may experience some difficulties and resolving these will give you greater understanding of Gulp, Node, and NPM.

<br>

After you’ve completed these katas, pick a few tasks and apply them to your own project.  Start with minification of your JavaScript and CSS.  

<br>

> Another common task is concatenating multiple JavaScript files
> together as this is a current common practice for performance.  This
> is to compensate for a shortcoming of HTTP protocol.  With the
> adoption of HTTP2, you will no longer be required to concatenate files
> for performance.
